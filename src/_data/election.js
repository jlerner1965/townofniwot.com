/* 2026 Niwot incorporation election.

   This file is held to a stricter standard than the rest of the site.

   - Nothing here argues for or against incorporation. Measures are described
     as filed, without commentary on whether they are advisable.
   - The certified ballot language published by the Niwot Election Commission
     controls. Everything here is a plain-language summary of it.
   - The Commission scheduled printer's-proof review for September 11, 2026.
     Re-check this content against the Commission's official ballot page after
     that date before treating any of it as final, and update `verified` in
     src/_data/site.js when you do.
   - Campaign material is labeled as advocacy wherever it appears, and the
     Commission is never presented as an advocate.
   - `official` on a question or issue is the Commission's own label for it
     ("Question 1", "Issue 1"), rendered beside the summary. The labels were
     read from the Commission's ballot page by the September 10, 2026 launch
     audit, whose order this file now follows; confirm them against the
     certified ballot after the proof review, and clear a label rather than
     leave a wrong one.

   The qualifications added on 2026-09-09 (the food exemption, the
   marijuana tax's start and conditions, the constitutional revenue limits
   and the 2027 start, the bond's repayment source, the dependency of the
   charter commission on incorporation) follow the pre-launch audit's
   reading of the Commission's ballot page and summaries on that date. The
   2026-09-10 additions (the official labels, the first-full-year revenue
   figures the ballot text states for the first three issues, the number of
   candidates for Question 3, and the split of roles between the Commission
   and the County Clerk) follow the launch audit's reading of the same page.
   Confirm each against the certified text after the proof review.

   Anything that cannot be supported by a filed document or an official
   publication is removed rather than softened. */

  'The proposed boundary is not the same as the Niwot census designated place. The 4,306 people counted there in 2020 are not the electorate for this vote, and not necessarily the population of the proposed town. The petition’s Exhibits A and B describe the boundary; the Commission’s FAQ explains how to check an address against them.',
